# 2.9. Restricting the Work Envelope

When installing the robot, you can restrict a specific work envelope within the entire work envelope. 

Restricting the work envelope will be useful in the following environments.

-	When there is a collision with a peripheral device
-	When the length of the application cables or hose is limited

The three methods to use to limit the work envelope of the robot are as follows.

-	Software limit (applied to all axes)
-	Limit switch (axes 1–3: optional)
-	Stopper (axis 1)
