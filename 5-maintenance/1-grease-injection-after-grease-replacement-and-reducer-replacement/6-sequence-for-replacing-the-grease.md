# 5.1.6. Sequence for Replacing the Grease

(1)	Pose the robot such that grease injection can be performed without any interference from surrounding facilities.

(2)	Pose the robot such that the positions of the grease inlet and outlet are as far apart as possible.

(3)	Turn off the power of the controller.

(4)	Remove the plugs from the grease inlet and outlet.

(5)	When grease is injected while the outlet plug is not removed, the internal pressure will rise and the grease will momentarily spurt out. Before injecting the grease, you must check whether the outlet plug is removed.

(6)	Decrease the air pressure of the oil pump to the minimum pressure at which grease can be discharged (0.025 Mpa or below.)

(7)	Attach a grease receiver such as vinyl with an opened entrance to the grease outlet to prevent the contamination of the surrounding area.

(8)	The entrance of the grease receiver must be kept opened to prevent the pressure inside the grease barrel from rising.

(9)	Prepare the oil pump and grease receiver in a way that enables you to measure the amounts of injected grease and discharged grease.
(10) Inject the grease by connecting the injection hose to the inlet.

(11) Inject the grease until the color of the grease discharged through the grease outlet changes sufficiently to the color of the new grease.

(12) Compare the amounts of injected grease and discharged grease, and then, if grease is excessively injected, subtract the excess grease to make sure that the amount of the injected grease is the same as that of the discharged grease by referring to the “Sequence for Subtracting the Residual Pressure” and the “Sequence for Discharging the Grease.”
