Abnormal sounds may occur when replacing the current grease with new grease of a different specification, so make sure that different types of grease are not mixed. When injecting grease, the user must observe the following.</td>

(1)	Wear safety glasses before injecting grease and conducting inspections.

(2)	Remove the grease inlet and outlet plugs before injecting grease.

(3)	When the plug is loosened, grease and the plug could be discharged abruptly. Block the outlet with a thick cloth to prevent injuries caused by discharged grease or plugs, and keep distance for safety. (Do not look into the grease outlet.)

(4)	If possible, do not use a compressed air pump powered by factory-supplied air, and limit the grease injection pressure to 1.5bar (1.5 kgf/cm2, 0.15 MPa) or less. 

(5)	Use only the specified grease. Otherwise, the reducer may be damaged or other problems may occur.

(6)	After injecting the grease, check for any leakage from the grease outlet and remove residual pressure according to the method suggested for each axis, and then connect the plug.

(7)	To prevent possible accidents, completely remove any excess grease leaked on the manipulator or floor.

(8)	If the robot is used at an ambient temperature of 35℃ or higher, the grease replenishment and replacement cycles should be shortened by half.

(9)	When replacing grease, replace the specified amount. Inject new grease until it is equal in amount to the grease that has been discharged.

(10) Abnormal sounds may be generated from the reducer part during operation after the replenishment or replacement of grease, at low temperature, at low speed, or after long-term nonoperation. In that case, you need to operate the robot while checking the state of the abnormal sounds for 1 to 2 days. Abnormal sounds caused by grease will disappear in normal conditions.

(11) If grease with a different specification is injected into a reducer part greased already, abnormal sounds may occur from the reducer part. Therefore, be careful not to mix different types of grease. Please replace GADUS grease with GADUS grease and RV LB00 grease with RV LB00 grease.

(12) Abnormal sounds may occur even if the old grease is replaced with the new grease of the same designated specification as the old grease.

(13) Replacing the grease does not completely remove the old grease. A significant amount of old grease will remain.



* Grease Replacement Cycle

   -	1-axis (S-axis) reducer, arm frame gearbox  : Every 24,000 h
   -	Other reducers  : Every 12,000 h
   -	Gas spring bearing  : Every 6 months (every 3 months if in hard conditions)

* Causes and Measures for Abnormal Sounds with Grease

If there is still noise in the reducer part even after using the specified grease, operate the robot while checking the state closely for 1–2 days. Generally, the noise will go away.

-	You can see that the noise disappears even when you operate the axis at high speeds for more than 5 to 10 min.
-	When the old grease is discharged as much as possible (about 90% or more) and replaced with new grease, abnormal grease sounds can be minimized. (When the grease is discharged while the axis is rotating at a low speed, the grease discharge time can be shortened.)

The noise may be caused by the following.
-	Operation after greasing or replacing the reducer
-	Operation after long-term disuse
-	Operation at a low speed
-	Operation at a low temperature
-	Use of unspecified grease
-	Mixing of grease of different specifications
