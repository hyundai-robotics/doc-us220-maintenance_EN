# 6.5.4. Mastering (option)

When performing the encoder data compensation after replacing a motor, first turn Power Ready mode “ON,” and check whether power is supplied to the motor.

When the mastering option is added, mastering is possible for axes 1 to 5, and the attachment location of each mastering sensor is shown in Figure 6.6.

Mastering should be performed in the following cases:

*	Motor Replacement
*	Replacement of a reducer
*	When the axis is displaced after an external collision

In addition, there is no need to compensate the encoder separately after mastering
For detailed mastering methods, please refer to the Hi6 Controller Manual.
