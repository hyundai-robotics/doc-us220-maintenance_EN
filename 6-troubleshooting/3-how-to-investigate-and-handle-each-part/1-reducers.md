# 6.3.1. Reducer

If the reducer is damaged, phenomena such as vibration and abnormal sounds will appear. In this situation, abnormalities such as overload and deviation that will interfere with normal operation and abnormal heating may occur. Also, there are cases wherein the robot does not move at all.

*	When required to replace the reducer, take some arm drop prevention measures (fixing using a pin or fixing using a crane) before doing the work.

    *	Investigation method

        ①	Investigate whether there are any abnormal phenomena, such as vibration, abnormal sound, abnormal heating, an error because of motor overload, etc., during operation.

        ②	Investigate whether there are any abnormal sounds, tool overloads, delays in the replacement of grease, etc.

        ③	Investigate whether the robot has collided with a peripheral system, etc.<br>
        (There are some cases wherein the reducer is damaged because of a collision.)

    *	Handling method

        ①	When it is determined to be the abnormal grease sound,
        -	operate the relevant axis at high speed until the grease sound disappears.
        -	If the abnormal sound does not disappear even after operating the axis at high speed for a long time, you should discharge the existing grease as much as possible and then inject new grease.

        ②	Take measures to prevent tool overload, interference, or collisions with surroundings.
        
        ③	It is necessary to replace the reducer in case of use in an overloaded state, collision, presence of foreign substances inside the reducer, or when grease has not been replaced for a long time. If you have any difficulty in replacing the reducer, please contact our service department.
