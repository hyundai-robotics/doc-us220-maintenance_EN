# 6.3.4. Encoder



If an encoder has an abnormality, it may cause position deviation, false operation, runaway, etc., which may lead to shaking when stopping or irregular pulsation. In addition, these issues have nothing to do with the occurrence of abnormal mechanical sounds, heating, and vibration.

*	Investigation method

    ①	Investigate whether there are any abnormalities in the encoder data.
    
    ②	Set to the reference position of the origin setting scale, and check whether there are any errors in the position data.

    ③	While moving each axis of the robot, investigate whether there is an axis showing an irregularity in the data.

    ④	Investigate whether an error does not occur when the servo amplifier board, BD640, is replaced.
 
*	Handling method

    ①	Check the wiring, and if it is not disconnected, replace the encoder.
