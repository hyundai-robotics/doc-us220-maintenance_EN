# 6.3.5. Gas spring

If the pressure of the gas spring drops below the reference value (100 bar), it may cause abnormal heating and overloading in the motor of the 2 axis or cause the arm to fall. 
Fill it with nitrogen gas so that the pressure does not drop more than 5 bar below the reference pressure.

Periodically inject grease into the upper and lower bearings of the gas spring to prevent the bearings from being damaged.

*	Investigation method

    ①	Check whether the pressure of the gas spring is appropriate, by referring to “9.1. Checking of the Pressure of the Gas Spring.”

    ②	Check if dust is generated at the bearing part of the gas spring.

    ③	If grease has not been injected into the bearing part for a long time, you should operate the robot to check if there is any abnormal vibration and noise.

*	Handling method

    ①	For the pressure of the gas spring, fill it with nitrogen gas based on Table 9.1.

    ②	Replace the gas spring with a new one when its pressure drops within a short period after the filling of nitrogen gas, or when the gas spring has been in operation for a long time at low pressure.

    ③	Fill the grease in the bearing part by referring to “5.1.16. Gas Spring Bearing Inlet.”

    ④	Replace the bearing if it is abnormal.

    ⑤	If you have any difficulties with the handling method, please contact our service department.

    ⑥	For replenishing the gas, comply with “9.2. Replenishing of the Gas of the Gas Spring.”

    ⑦	For the pressure reference and replacement, comply with “9.4. Replacing (Separating and Assembling) the Gas Spring.”
