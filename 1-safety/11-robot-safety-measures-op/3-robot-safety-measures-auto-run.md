# 1.11.3. Safety Measures for Auto Operation

Safety is very important when operating the robot automatically, so the following should be observed.

*	Put a [Do Not Enter During Operation] sign on the entrance gate of the safety fence, and strictly ask workers to refrain from entering during the operation. If the robot is stopped, you may go inside the safety fence after judging the situation

*	When required to start auto operation, you must check whether there is a worker inside the safety fence. If you work without checking for the presence of a worker, an accident involving a person may occur. 

*	When required to start auto operation, start it after confirming that the program number, the step number, the mode, the selection for staring, etc. are all in a state that auto operation can be performed. If you start auto operation while a different program or step is selected, the robot may perform an unexpected operation, causing an accident. 

*	When required to start auto operation, start it after confirming that the robot is in a position that enables the start of the auto operation. Check whether the program number or step number matches the position of the robot. Even when the program number or step number is correct, if the robot is in a different position, an accident may occur because of an operation that is different from usual operations. 

*	When required to start auto operation, you should be prepared to press the emergency stop switch immediately. If an unexpected operation of the robot or an unexpected situation occurs, press emergency stop switch immediately. 

*	Identify the operation path, operation status, operation sound, etc. of the robot in a way to judge whether there is any abnormal state. Robots may suddenly malfunction or cause abnormalities. However, there are cases where the robot shows some signs before it fails. To foresee a failure in advance, you should grasp the state of the normal operation of the robot. 

*	If you identified any abnormality, immediately perform an emergency stop and take appropriate measures against the abnormality. If the robot is used without proper measures taken, not only the production will stop but also a severe failure that may cause a major accident that involves a person may occur. 

*	When required to complete the actions after an abnormality has occurred, do not operate the robot while a worker is inside the safety fence. Otherwise, because of low reliability, an unexpected accident, such as occurrence of abnormality, may occur. 

*	Before selecting automatic mode, if any safety device function that has been halted is found, recover it fully before carrying out the next task.
