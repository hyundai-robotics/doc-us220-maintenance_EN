# 1.11.1. Safety Measures for Handling the Robot

Please observe the following measures because safety is very important when operating the robot.

*	The workers who operate or may operate the robot, and the supervisors must fully recognize the safety and the function of the robot by taking prescribed trainings. The robot must not be operated by anyone other than those who have been so trained and designated.

*	Before operating the robot, a qualified installation expert must confirm that the product has been installed in compliance with the relevant regulations and laws of the concerned country or region.

*	Before operating the robot, check whether the safety functions are working normally.

*	Must wear a safety hat, protective glasses and safety shoes. 

*	The work must be done by two people. One person performs teaching and the other monitors from the operation panel. One person should be ready to press the emergency stop switch at any time, and the other one should proceed with the works quickly while paying much attention in the work envelope. In addition, workers should check the evacuation routes in advance before the work.

*	Supply the power after confirming that there are no workers inside the safety guard.

*	In principle, work such as teaching should be performed outside the robot safety guard. However, when required to stop the robot and work within the work envelope, please go inside while carrying the safety plug, which is the mode switch key (or switch to change to automatic operation). It is necessary to ensure that other workers do not mistakenly switch the robot to auto operation. In addition, pay special attention to the operational direction of the robot in preparation for an unexpected situation such as false operations or wrong conditions. 


※	A supervisor should observe the following items.

    -	Position yourself in a place where you can see the entire robot and devote yourself to the monitoring work.
    -	When there is an abnormality, press the emergency stop button immediately.
    -	Make sure that no one other than those involved in the work is within the work envelope


*	Basically, the maximum speed during manual operation is limited to 250 mm/s. At this time, the workers inside and outside the guard should be prepared to press the emergency stop switch at any time if a problem occurs.

*	During manual operation at a high-speed mode, the operation should be performed from outside the safety guard.

*	When performing the teaching work, you should put a sign saying [Teaching in Progress.]

*	When entering a safety guard, the workers must pull the safety plug or an equivalent device and bring it with themselves.

*	Do not use equipment that may cause noise in or around the place where teaching work is performed.

*	Handle the teach pendant button while looking at the teaching point with your naked eyes, not by handling it just relying on the feeling of your hands.

*	Take the following measures when an abnormality occurs.

    -	If there is an abnormal operation spotted, press the emergency stop button immediately.

    -	When checking for an abnormality following an emergency stop, you must check the state of the stopping of the related facilities.

    -	If the robot automatically stops because of an abnormality in the power supply, you should first confirm that the robot has stopped completely and then investigate the cause and take measures.

    -	If the emergency stop system does not perform its functions, you should cut off the main power immediately, investigate the causes, and take measures.

    -	No one except for the designated person should investigate the cause. Restarting after an emergency stop should be performed in sequence after the cause of the error is clearly identified and measures are taken.

*	Create appropriate work regulations regarding not only the methods to drive and operate the robot but also the measures to take against abnormalities, considering the location of the installation and content of the work. In addition, work according to the work regulations.

*	Precautions When the Robot is Stopped

    -	You must avoid blindly approaching the robot assuming it is stationary. There are many cases where a person approached a robot the person thought was stationary, but the robot suddenly moved, resulting in a disaster. When the robot is stopped, it is in the following states.

*	During a temporary stop, when opening the entrance gate to handle a minor abnormality (nozzle contact, detection of deposition, arc error, etc.), the same measures applied for entering and exiting for teaching work should be taken to enter and exit.

*	After completing the operation of the robot, you should clean the inside of the safety fence and make sure that no tools, oil, foreign substances, etc. are left there. If the work envelope is dirty with oil or littered with tools left, an accident such as a falling over may be caused. Always make it a habit to keep things organized and tidy.
