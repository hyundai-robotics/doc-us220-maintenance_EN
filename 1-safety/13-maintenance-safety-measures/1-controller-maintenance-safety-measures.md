# 1.13.1. Safety Measures for Inspecting and Maintaining the Controller

Please observe the following safety measures when inspecting and maintaining the robot controller.

*	Inspection and maintenance works should be performed only by those who have received special maintenance trainings and fully understand the relevant contents.

*	Progress the works according to the procedures for inspecting and maintaining the controller.

*	Must perform the inspection and maintenance works safely after securing a passage or a place to avoid danger by checking the safety of the surroundings.

*	Must turn off the power when required to perform daily inspections, repairs, or replacement of parts of the robot. In addition, put a warning sign such as [Do Not Supply Power] on the primary power source so that other workers cannot turn on the power carelessly.

*	Use only the designated replacement parts.

*	When required to open the controller door, you must turn off the power and then wait for about three minutes before starting the work.

*	When carrying out maintenance or inspection work inside the controller, if sufficient illumination is not secured, use external lighting.

*	Do not touch the heat radiation plate and regenerative resistor of the servo amplifier because they generate excessive heat. After completing maintenance, you should check if tools or other things are left inside the controller and then securely close the door.
