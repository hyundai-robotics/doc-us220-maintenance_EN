The installation should be performed by qualified installation personnel and conform with the relevant regulations and laws of the concerned country and region.

*	When unpacking the robot, check it for any possible damages that could occur during transporting or unpacking.

*	Before installing the product after unpacking it, the user must check the safety regulations and instructions and product installation and use environment information and fully understand the installation method.

*	Workers who use the robot should fully understand the contents described in application and supplementary manuals to skillfully operate and handle the industrial robot. 

*	Workers who install the robot should be able to apply safety instructions if problems occur during installation. 

*	System suppliers should ensure that all circuits using safety functions surely perform the functions. 

*	The main power supplied to the robot should be installed so that it can be cut off from outside the work envelope of the robot. 

*	The system suppliers should clearly ensure that all circuits using the emergency stop function perform the function in a safe manner. 

*	For a case that requires stopping the robot abruptly, the emergency stop button should be located in a place where workers can easily access it.

*	Should take into consideration the size of the manipulator and the operation range to ensure that there is no interference with peripheral devices. 

*	Avoid installing the robot in places that can be reached by direct sunlight, where humidity is high, oil or chemicals are present, or a lot of metal powder or explosive gasses are in the air.

*	Install the robot where the ambient temperature is within the range of 0℃–45℃.

*	Secure enough space to easily disassemble and inspect the robot.

*	Install a safety fence and prevent people from entering the work envelope of the robot.

*	Make sure that there is no obstacle in the work envelope of the robot.

*	When required to install the robot in a place exposed to direct sunlight or near a heating element, you should take measures in consideration of the thermodynamic state of the controller.

*	When required to install the root in a place where there is a lot of dust such as metal powder in the air, you should take separate measures.

*	Install the robot in a way that the welding current never flows to the robot. In other words, there must be insulation between the spot gun and the wrist of the robot.

*	Considering that grounding is very important in preventing a false operation because of noise and an electric shock, you should carry out installation as follows.

    - A dedicated grounding terminal should be installed, and its grade must be higher than class 3 grounding. 

    - The grounding wire should be connected to the grounding bus bar inside the control panel. 

    -	When the manipulator is installed, if it is directly grounded to the floor by an anchor, etc., the controller side and the manipulator side constitute two grounding points, conversely causing a closed circuit to be formed with a risk of a false operation because of noise conversely. In this case, connect the grounding wire to the base of the manipulator and do not connect it to the controller side. Also, if vibration occurs when the robot is stopped, it is highly likely that the grounding is incomplete or a closed circuit has formed. Check the grounding again. 

    -	When a transformer-embedded gun is used, there is a risk of falling because the primary power cable is directly connected to the spot gun. In this case, to protect the control panel and prevent an electric shock, you should connect the grounding wire directly to the manipulator base and do not connect it to the controller.


*	Install by referring to “3.4. Installation Methods.”

*	Specify the soft limit according to the site conditions. After that, you must ensure that the location and adjustment of the hardware limit is performed by a trained operator. You must check whether it is working when installed.
