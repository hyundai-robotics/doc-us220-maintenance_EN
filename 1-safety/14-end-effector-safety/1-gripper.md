# 1.14.1. Gripper

*	When required to use a gripper, there should be preparatory measures in place in case the workpiece unexpectedly falls.

*	When required to mount a device to the top of an end effector or arm, use the bolts of specified sizes in specified counts, and use a torque wrench to tighten them with the specified torques. Also, the bolts that are not rusted or contaminated should be used.

*	Manufacture the end effectors by reviewing whether it can be used within the allowable load range of the wrists of the robot. In addition, the end effectors should be structured such that the gripped object will not be released or dropped even when the power or air supply is stopped and also that its corners or protruding parts are finished to prevent damage to people/objects.
