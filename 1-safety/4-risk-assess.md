# 1.4. Risk assessment

Risk assessment is one of the most important factors in constructing an integrated system, including robots, to the extent that it is treated as a legal requirement in most countries. Depending on how the robot is integrated into the system, the safety assessment related to the installation of the robot will vary, so it is impossible to assess the risk of an integrated system only based on the robot alone.

The system manager should conduct risk assessment by configuring and operating a robotic system according to the guidelines of ISO 12100 and ISO 10218-2.

Risk assessment should be conducted considering the entire process of the integrated system, including the robot. The main objectives of risk assessment are as follows.

*	Basic settings for using and teaching the robot

*	Diagnosis of issues and maintenance

*	Normal operation of the installed robot

Users must perform risk assessment after installing the robot and configuring the system. Risk assessment primarily judges the adequacy of the safety devices in the robot integrated system as well as the necessity for additional emergency stop devices and other safety devices. It is very important to properly configure the robot integrated system by identifying the appropriate safety devices. Users are required to configure the robot integrated system by referring to the relevant information in the manual. For details on configuring safety functions, please refer to “1.8. Safety Functions.” In addition, when required to install a robot in a specific location or configure safety-related functions using safety I/O, the important items regarding the risk assessment of the robot integrated system are as follows.

*	Severity

*	Frequency of exposure to risk

*	Possibility of occurrence

*	Possibility of avoidance

When configuring an integrated system, if the safety-related functions of the robot do not sufficiently eliminate risk factors, a risk assessment may identify the need for additional protective devices.
