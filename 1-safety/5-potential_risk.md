# 1.5. Potential Risks

If the risk assessment of the integrated system linked to the robot derives results showing that the safety-related functions of the robot alone do not sufficiently eliminate risk factors, additional protective measures must be established.

The things to consider when establishing additional protective measures are as follows.

*	Fingers caught (crushed) between the robot base and the installation platform during installation

*	Injuries (punctures, penetration, etc.) caused by sharp edges or the pointed parts of the obstacles or tools in the work envelope.

*	Injuries (bruises, falls, fractures, etc.) caused by collision with the robot

*	Injuries (punctures, penetration, fractures, etc.) caused by obstacles around the robot

*	Injuries that may occur if a fastened part is not completely fixed

*	Injuries (skin damage, breathing difficulties, etc.) that may occur when working with toxic or hazardous substances

*	A workpiece dislodged from a tool because of a sudden power interruption

*	Mistakes caused by confusion with emergency stop switches on other equipment

*	Errors caused by arbitrarily changing the settings of safety-related functions, etc.

Because the types of risks that may occur vary depending on the system configuration, users must conduct a risk assessment before using the integrated system.
