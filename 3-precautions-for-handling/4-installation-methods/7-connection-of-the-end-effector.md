# 3.4.7. Connection of the End Effector

For the tool to be attached to the tip of the robot’s wrist axis, the attachment method and form of the tool should be restricted to prevent abrasion from the contact with the 6-axis part that performs relative movement. If the restriction is not appropriate, the seal of the reducer may be damaged because of contact, resulting in oil leakage.
