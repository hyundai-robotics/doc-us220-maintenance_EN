# 8.2.2. Disposal of the Gas Spring

Because high pressure still remains inside the gas spring separated from the manipulator, remove the gas according to the procedures of “9.3. Releasing of the Gas of the Gas Spring,” confirm that the gas is completely removed, and then dispose of the gas spring. Also, because a small amount of grease will remain inside, it should be handled according to the relevant laws and regulations in an environment sensitive to contamination.
