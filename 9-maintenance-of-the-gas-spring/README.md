    <td class="tg-cly1">-	Nitrogen gas is filled at high pressure, so the safety regulations of the concerned country should be observed.<br>
-	To prevent the arm from falling, maintain the pressure of the gas spring at an appropriate working pressure.<br>
-	When required to operate the 2 axis manually, first check whether the gas spring is at an appropriate working pressure.<br>
-	Never go under the direction of the arm falling.<br>
-	Fill only nitrogen gas.<br>
(Never charge any type of gas or liquid other than nitrogen gas.)<br>
-	Wear safety glasses when working.<br> 
-	Fill nitrogen gas so that the pressure does not drop more than 5 bar below the reference pressure.<br>
-	Never look directly into the gas inlet and pressure gauge.<br>
-	When the internal parts of the gas spring are damaged, secure safety by not placing any part of the body or major equipment in the operation direction of the gas spring, and then completely remove the gas.<br>
(When an internal part is damaged, the compression force causes it to be thrown out at high speed, resulting in accidents.)<br>
-	When required to separate the gas spring assembly unit, separate it while keeping the 2 axis of the robot at an angle of 90 degrees (teach pendant.) When in this posture, the compression force of the gas spring is minimized, making it possible to separate it.<br> 
(When in other postures, the gas spring compression force is high, so the bolts will be thrown out at high speed during the separation work, resulting in accidents.)<br>
-	To consider safety and maintain the performance of the product, the works of disassembling and assembling the internal parts of the gas spring should be performed using only designated standard work tools and equipment as well as with the appropriate trainings and understanding of the product. Please contact us for any inquiries regarding this.<br>
-	When measuring the gas pressure, observe the instruction in “9.1. Checking of the Pressure of the Gas Spring” because incorrect operation of the measuring device or mistakes in operating it may result in a drop in the gas pressure.<br>
-	Before checking the gas spring, you must ensure that the controller and external power are in the 『OFF』 state. Also, take measures to prevent the controller and external power from being accidently turned 『ON』 by someone else.<br>
-	When required to replace the gas spring, you must remove the gas pressure first.<br>
-	When replacing an old gas spring, replace the bearing as well.<br>
-	Regularly inject grease into the bearing part of the gas spring.<br>
(Every 6 months or every 3 months in harsh conditions)<br>
- When purchasing gas injection parts, include the specification of the nitrogen gas bombe connection screws.
