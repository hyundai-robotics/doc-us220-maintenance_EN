# 9.3. Releasing of the Gas of the Gas Spring

Release the gas of the gas spring in the following cases.

-	When the gas spring needs to be separated from the robot, but the 2 axis cannot be operated, making it impossible to put the 2 axis at 90°
-	When required to transport the robot by air (The law states that air transport of machinery equipped with high-pressure equipment should be performed after depressurizing it.)

(1)	Remove the plug installed to the gas inlet of the gas spring.

(2)	Check whether the handle of the bleed valve ○P is closed (locked clockwise.)

(3)	Check whether the gas release pin of the marked part ○R is protruding. If it is protruding, turn the knob ○O counterclockwise to prevent this.

(4)	Turn the knob ○N of the pressure tester clockwise to completely connect it to the gas inlet

(5)	Turn the knob ○O clockwise and then stop turning it if the pointer of the pressure gauge ○T moves.(To avoid making the release pin ○R go inside excessively and damage the valve inside the gas spring, do not turn the knob ○O handle excessively.)

(6)	 Turn the bleed valve ○P counterclockwise slowly to completely release the gas.
Warning! Never look directly into the gas outlet hole.

(7)	Turn the knob ○O handle counterclockwise to retreat the release pin ○R. After that, turn the knob ○N of the pressure tester counterclockwise to separate it.

(8)	Connect the G1/8 plug to the gas spring.
